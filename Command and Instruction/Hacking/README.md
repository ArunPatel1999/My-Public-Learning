### Wi-Fi Security Vulnerabilities

#### Dictionary Attack
- **Concept**: Systematic password cracking using common passwords
- **Target**: WPA/WPA2 encrypted networks with weak passwords
- **Tools**: Wordlist-based password cracking tools
- **Defense**: Use strong, complex passwords with mixed characters
- **Detection**: Monitor for repeated authentication failures

#### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
- **Concept**: Intercepting communication between two parties
- **Techniques**: 
  - Rogue Access Point creation
  - ARP spoofing and poisoning
  - DNS hijacking and redirection
  - SSL/TLS certificate manipulation
- **Targets**: Unencrypted or poorly secured wireless networks
- **Impact**: Data interception, credential theft, session hijacking
- **Prevention**: 
  - Use encrypted connections (HTTPS, VPN)
  - Verify SSL certificates
  - Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities
  - Enable network encryption (WPA3)

### Network Security Fundamentals
- **Wireless Protocols**: Understanding WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3 security
- **Encryption Methods**: Different encryption standards and vulnerabilities
- **Authentication**: Various authentication mechanisms and weaknesses
- **Network Monitoring**: Packet capture and analysis techniques

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Concepts

### Wireless Network Security

#### Encryption Standards
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**
  - Deprecated due to serious vulnerabilities
  - Easily crackable with modern tools
  - Should never be used in production

- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**
  - Improvement over WEP but still vulnerable
  - Susceptible to dictionary attacks
  - Legacy protocol with known weaknesses

- **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)**
  - Current standard for most networks
  - Strong encryption when properly configured
  - Vulnerable to KRACK attacks in some implementations

- **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III)**
  - Latest and most secure standard
  - Enhanced protection against password attacks
  - Improved encryption and authentication

### Attack Methodologies

#### Reconnaissance Phase
- **Network Discovery**: Identify available wireless networks
- **Signal Analysis**: Determine network strength and coverage
- **Device Enumeration**: Identify connected devices and services
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Scan for known security weaknesses

#### Attack Execution
- **Passive Attacks**: Monitor network traffic without interaction
- **Active Attacks**: Directly interact with target systems
- **Social Engineering**: Human-based attack vectors
- **Physical Access**: Direct hardware manipulation

#### Post-Exploitation
- **Data Extraction**: Retrieve sensitive information
- **Persistence**: Maintain access to compromised systems
- **Lateral Movement**: Expand access within the network
- **Evidence Cleanup**: Remove traces of unauthorized access

## üîß Defensive Measures

### Network Hardening
```bash
# Change default passwords
# Enable WPA3 encryption
# Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
# Hide SSID broadcast (security through obscurity)
# Enable MAC address filtering
# Regular firmware updates
```

### Monitoring & Detection
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor for suspicious activity
- **Network Monitoring**: Continuous traffic analysis
- **Log Analysis**: Review system and network logs
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual network behavior

### Access Control
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical systems
- **VPN Usage**: Encrypt all remote connections
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layers
- **Regular Security Audits**: Periodic vulnerability assessments
