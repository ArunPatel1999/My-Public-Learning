	**Search engine integration with indexing and query operations.**
	
	This project contains basic operations related to Elasticsearch and Spring Boot.
	
	In this project, I performed the following operations:
	
	1) **Configuration related to Elasticsearch** - Setup and connection configuration
	
	2) **Product CRUD Operations** like:
	   - createIndex - Index creation and management
	   - findAll - Retrieve all documents
	   - findById - Find specific documents
	   - addProduct - Add new documents
	   - delete product and index - Remove documents and indices
	
	3) **Bulk operations** - bulkRead and bulkWrite for efficient data processing
