	# Core Java Features
	
	```
	This project contains Java-related code, feature testing, and other types of testing.
	
	In this project, I performed the following operations:
	
	1) CollectionsMethod that contains `Collections` methods:
	   i) Frequency of occurrence of a character.
	
	2) README.md Generator that follows a bottom-to-top approach: it copies all child README.md data and adds it to the parent.
	
	```
