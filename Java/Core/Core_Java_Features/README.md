# Core Java Features

```
This project contains Java-related code, feature testing, and other types of testing.

In this project, I performed the following operations:

1) CollectionsMethod that contains `Collections` methods:
   i) Frequency of occurrence of a character.

2) README.md Generator that follows a bottom-to-top approach: it copies all child README.md data and adds it to the parent.
